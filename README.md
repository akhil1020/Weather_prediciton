Weather Prediction Using Machine Learning: A Promising Approach
Weather forecasting plays a crucial role in various aspects of daily life, from agriculture and transportation to disaster preparedness. While traditional forecasting methods have significantly improved over the years, challenges remain in enhancing both accuracy and efficiency. Recent advancements in machine learning (ML) have introduced new possibilities for improving weather prediction. By analyzing vast datasets collected from weather stations worldwide, ML models can uncover complex patterns and relationships, leading to more precise and timely forecasts.

This research explores the application of supervised learning algorithms in weather prediction. We focus on models such as decision trees, logistic regression, and k-nearest neighbors to forecast weather conditions using historical data. Our dataset comprises daily weather measurements from multiple stations within a specific region, which we use to train and test these ML models.

Our study seeks to answer key questions, including:

Which ML algorithms are most effective for weather prediction?
How do dataset size and quality impact prediction accuracy?
Which features contribute the most to improving forecasting precision?
By addressing these questions, we aim to highlight the potential of ML-driven weather prediction and provide practical insights for leveraging these technologies in real-world applications.

## Conclusion
To validate our findings, we test one of the models developed during our research. We select a Decision Tree model trained using the month variable, extracted from the date column, with a max_depth of 4. This model achieves an accuracy of 83.87%, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting weather conditions.

Our research contributes to the growing body of work in AI-powered weather forecasting and sets the stage for further exploration and innovation in this domain. By proving the viability of ML techniques, we hope to inspire future advancements in predictive meteorology.
